                <p>Rock says that it is "inevitable that our work bears our stamp," is this true? Can a designer completely remove themself from their work?</p>
                <p> "The  meaning  of  his  work  is  not  in  the  story  but  in  the  storytelling." I really liked this reading. It kind of made me think of why I also tend to hyphen-label myself or not label myself at all because of this fear a lot of us have of boxing ourselves... is this a valid fear?  </p>
