<p>Destiny was born in New York on June 14, 1992, and came up against high hurdles at an early age. By nine, death had taken both her mother and grandmother. As a teenager, under turbulent and at times abusive conditions, she ran away to live with her grandmother and father. “One of the best decisions I have ever made.” Destiny describes her father as “a loving, non-judgmental feminist.” When she and I first met in 2010, she wasn’t hanging out with a group of teens, she was kickin’ it with her pops. Seventeen years old with a swoop bang channeling Aaliyah, light pink Chloé shades (you know, the ones with the rhinestone heart in the corner), matching plaid bikini and mini skirt, pacifier necklace, tiny anime backpack filled with comics and tarot cards, bumpin’ grimy New York rap in her headphones. An original.
