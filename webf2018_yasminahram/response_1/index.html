                <p> Is it possible to eliminate the expectations we have as visitors of an artist’s website to translate their artwork or style into the architecture and character of the website?</p>

<p>With an understanding that visual artist have a taste for the visual aesthetic, why does their website have to reach the standard of their work? Can it differ completely and still make sense? Is it designed more so for the visitor to appreciate the art, or for the artist to present their work in a certain way? </p>
