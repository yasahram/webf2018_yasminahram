                <h2>Response 4: UX </h2>
                <p> This reading was really interesting and made me question web design/UX in a really meta way... he says that "UX creates an illusion of unmediated space," so would it still be an illusion to create a UX that allows for actual unmediated space? is there such a thing as unmediated space in web design if UX involved? Is UX, whether a conscious part of the design process or not, embedded in design thinking?</p>

<p>Very cool thoughts: "the importance of being anthropomorphic" and "the designer as an author" of a "story that will be told but the product itself creates and shapes it."</p>
